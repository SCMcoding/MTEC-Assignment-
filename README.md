# MTEC-Assignment-
When I first started with this project, I was unsure on where to begin, there were 
just so many things I need to understand before building the terrain. I started with a
blank template, and I started to randomly create mountains. I added some trees 
and added some plants to go along with the terrain. For the sky, I used the space 
template that I downloaded from the unity store. I wanted to create an environment
that takes place in space, since I am a sci-fi person. The concept of space and the 
stars always intrigued me, and I always wanted to know the concept of possible life 
beyond our planet. There Is still a lot that I need to add to this project. But Iâ€™m 
looking forward to build on this project to improve its quality and vibe
